 * A **roster** is not a new entity: it is the set of Agents the platform
 * provisions for one person in one workspace scope, each carrying a
 * **lane**. Everything here is a closed vocabulary so the wizard, the
 * provisioning service and the DTO validators cannot drift apart — the
 * same trick `ROLE_OPTIONS` / `TEAM_SIZE_OPTIONS` already use one file
 * over.

 * A lane is a short, stable key naming the area of work one Agent owns
 * (FR-26). Seven ship with the build, and the catalogue is capped at 12
 * (FR-30) so the "add a lane" menu stays a menu rather than a directory.
 *
 * 🛑 A lane is a **label, not a permission** (FR-27). It grants nothing,
 * restricts nothing, and must never be consulted by an authorization
 * decision. It exists so a surface can ask "who owns research here?" and
 * get a stable answer instead of grepping free-text titles.
